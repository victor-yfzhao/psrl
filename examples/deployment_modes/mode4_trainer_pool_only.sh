# Three independent pools (rollout / rm / trainer) running concurrently, PLUS a
# FIXED number of extra rollout / rm replicas that are woken on train_pool GPUs
# while the trainer is idle, and SLEPT when the training step runs.
#
# Topology (2 nodes): rollout pool (4 GPUs, 4 main instances) + rm pool (4 GPUs,
# 4 main RM replicas) + train pool (8 GPUs, actor + idle rollout/rm replicas on
# DISJOINT bundles, time-multiplexed with actor via NIXL sleep/wake).

# Requirements: psrl.ps_mode in {nixl_cpu, nixl_gpu}. Idle rollout and idle rm
# replicas each occupy one GPU bundle on train_pool and must NOT share bundles;
# ensure IDLE_ROLLOUT_INSTANCES + IDLE_RM_INSTANCES <= PSRL_DEPLOY_TRAIN_NGPUS.
