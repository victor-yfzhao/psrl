"""Standalone deployment-mode resolution (no heavy imports).

`resolve_deployment_mode` maps the unified `psrl.deployment.mode` config entry
to the concrete `elastic_rm` flags that the rest of the codebase reads. It must
run BEFORE any code that branches on `elastic_rm.enable` / `enable_trainer_pool`
/ `enable_policy` — in particular before `main_ppo.TaskRunner.init_resource_pool_mgr`
(which lays out resource pools) and before `PSRL_RayPPOTrainer.__init__` derives
its mode flags.

It is intentionally free of ray / torch / nixl imports so it can be called from
`main_ppo` at the very top of `TaskRunner.run` without triggering implicit
`ray.init()`.
